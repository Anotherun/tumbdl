tumbdl
======

Tumblr image downloader and archiver

A simple bash script that scans the archive of a tumblelog and gets the image
files from the post pages. It keeps track of the post pages that have been
downloaded, so that existing images are not downloaded again. This makes it easy
to archive a tumblelog on your computer and update it if new images were posted.

Requirements: bash (Version?), wget, grep, egrep (nothing fancy, most distros
              should have them)


Usage example: ./tumbdl.sh prostbote.tumblr.com prost
